# Creating a Database of NYC Comedy
***

The goal is to create a central repository of comedy shows going on in New York City, since (apart from big shows) they are all listed on the individual comedy club websites.

Currently I have successfully scraped for the Comedy Cellar's shows.

Eventually the shows for each club will be combined into a database.
