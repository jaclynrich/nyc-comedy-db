# Creating and Exploring a Database of NYC Comedy Shows
***

The goal for this project is to create a central repository of comedy shows going on in New York City, since (apart from big shows) they are all listed on the individual comedy club websites.  Currently I have successfully scraped for shows from the Comedy Cellar, The Stand NYC, and Carolines.

The clubs were loaded into a MongoDB database and explored in the Scraping for, Storing, and Exploring New York City Comedy Shows.ipynb.
